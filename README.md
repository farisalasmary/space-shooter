# Space Shooter

This is a simple game I developed as a project for the second Java course (ICS 201) in Computer Science in King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM).

If you want to do further improvement to this project, it would be easier to import the project using Eclipse IDE.

You can run the program simply by double clicking on the file `spaceshooter.jar` and it will run.

Also, you can run it through the command line using the following command:

```Java
java -jar spaceshooter.jar
```

**Note:** You should have Java Virtual Machine on your computer.
